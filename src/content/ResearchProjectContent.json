    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing technology is yet not distributed equally and is available only for a small part of the world's people, mainly those living in the Global North. This is due to the scarcity of resources needed to develop NLP for the majority of our over 7,000 living languages. In this project, we aim to establish an approach to NLP that prioritises global fairness and inclusivity.",
